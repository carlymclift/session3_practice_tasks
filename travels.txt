My favorite travel experience was a trip I took to the Middle East a few years ago. This was such a cool experience because of the different culture I was able to see. I went with my best friend, whose family lived in Dubai and Jordan. I was able to be in Dubai on New Years and celebrate with amazing food and company. Jordan was also great, we went to the Dead Sea and walked on the Jordan river. Since his family lived there I was able to have a very authentic experience. It is a trip that I would definitely do again.
