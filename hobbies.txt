One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I love relaxing with either a coffee or adult beverage and getting lost in a story.
I also really enjoy being outdoors, whether is walking around my neighborhood with my two dogs, or going on a hike.
Painting and being creative is something I value doing in my free time. It's a good mental break for me.
Going to the gym is also a hobby I enjoy. I use to not like it but after going consistently for 4 years, I've learned to love it
